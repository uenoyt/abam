Abam 0.90
============

"Abam" stands for Animations for Biomolecular Artificial Muscle. This site is to provide
some of the useful code for modeling supermolecular complex of the target materials.
The work was supported by a academic research collaboration project.
We deposit model files and Blender animation script files to interpret dynamic property of the
molecular structure.

Authors and Contacts
====================
Abam modeling files were constructed at AIST, a national research institute in Japan by Yutaka Ueno.

Blender Files
============

In the directory blender298 files are made Blender ver 2.98, that is compatible with newest Blender.

1. fitmap7.blend
The cylinder model of microtubule filaments are fitted into the observed volume density map
of the microtubule mesh structure.

2. mtpull10a.blend
A tentative model of the contractile element of microtubule filaments with kinesin multimer complex.

3. kinosu10f.blend
A possible contraction model for the microtubule mesh structure using the contractile element.
